# TEMPERATURE-CONTROLLED-DC-FAN
This Temperature Controlled DC Fan system uses an operational amplifier to compare voltages from a potentiometer and a thermistor. As temperature rises, thermistor resistance drops, activating the fan via a transistor. If temperature falls, the fan turns off. Arduino measures voltage changes to calculate temperature.
